# Password-Generator

When the 'Generate Password' button is clicked, the website prompts for password length (8 to 128 characters), as well as asking which of the following character types should be included in the password:
 - Lowercase
 - Uppercase
 - Numeric
 - Special

Validation:
At least one character type must be chosen, and at least one character from each chosen character type must be included in the generated password.
